# The Button (Provisory name) (Trademark pending)

One of mankind's oldest enigmas is "how many times can I press a button before something bad happens?". _The Buttonâ„¢_ is a revolutionary idea that aims to resolve this eternal question, ~~and also end world hunger~~.


The Button is an _NextJS_ app designed to do something. What's going to do exactly? That's for the future to tell.
